# Fab Stresstest

I originally designed these boards as competitive analysis boards,
to test the actual capabilities of other fabs.  

These are interesting because they contain lots of features that
make them deliberately difficult to manufacture, and simple to test
with a small set of test points.

Measure for continuity between 1 and 1, and 1 and 2, and 2 and 2,
and it will tell you if there are any shorts or breaks on the entire
board.
